IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (Please read)
Since a lot of the rou.xml files (for testing and training) were too large to be committed to the git repo, we were not able to push them to the git repository (git did not allow to do so). Please run create_route_file.ipynb to regenerate a week's worth of training data 
using information from the database. Essentially, the file create_route_file.ipynb creates all the SUMO rou.xml TRAINING files.

The TESTING rou.xml file is titled: testing_routes_sumo.rou.xml (The 24-hour XML file is large, so it is shared via this onedrive link: https://utoronto-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/t_pazhaidam_mail_utoronto_ca/EWf09oxxA9REjshyd4aNKhgBTMEh8O3lH7czN5KqdKcYJw?e=eeCvhT )
Please let us know if you have trouble accessing the large testing route file.


The code that was used to extract data, preprocess it, and accumulate the database can be found in traffic_dataset_extraction.ipynb.
The actual SUMO RL implementation and training and testing code can be found in sumo_environment_train_and_test.ipynb.
