IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS (Please read)
Since a lot of the rou.xml files (for testing and training) were too large to be committed to the git repo, they must be dynamically created by running the code. Please run create_route_file.ipynb to regenerate a week's worth of training data 
using information from the database. Essentially, the file create_route_file.ipynb creates all the SUMO rou.xml TRAINING files, while the
file testing_route_file_creation.ipynb creates the TESTING rou.xml file for SUMO. 

The code that was used to extract data, preprocess it, and accumulate the database can be found in traffic_dataset_extraction.ipynb.
The actual SUMO RL implementation and training and testing code can be found in sumo_environment_train_and_test.ipynb.
